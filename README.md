# Rocket.Chat Buddy Status

A quick proof-of-concept project to provide online status of Rocket.Chat buddies. More traditional chat programs like [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) or [Steam Chat](https://steamcommunity.com/chat/) provide a "buddy" list so you can see who is online. In Rocket.Chat, you can certainly add people to favorites but if you are also subscribed to any number of channels it can get pretty noisy.

## Getting Started

The project has been set up as a [GitHub Project Page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) so it is easy to see how it works; see https://gkhays.github.io/rc-buddy-status/.
